# UXphenomena
 Uxphenomena was an idea of mine trying to build up my startup that is specialized in design and tech solutions like web 
development, cross platform mobile app, UI/UX design and graphics.
â€¢ In the end, I had to postpone it for some years until i have the needed experience to manage real projects and teams on 
my own.

PS. the 'Team' Link is not done due to postpone reasons.
